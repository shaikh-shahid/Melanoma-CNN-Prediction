## General Information
To build a CNN-based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
As the accuracy of the model increases, the loss decreases. The final model has an accuracy of 87% and a loss of 0.3. The model can predict the class of the lesion with a high accuracy. Augmenting the data and countering class imbalance helped in improving the accuracy of the model.
